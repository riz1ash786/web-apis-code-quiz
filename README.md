# Week 4 - Code Quiz

## Description

- I have been tasked to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions using JavaScript fundamentals. The quiz will include multiple questions alongside a timer. If a question is answered incorrectly then the time will be subtracted to the clock. Upon completion of the quiz then the user will be able to save their score alongside their initials.

## Acceptance Criteria - Checklist

- the quiz starts when the start button is clicked and clears the content to initialise the fist question and response options for the user.

- The timer also starts when the user commences the quiz and is displayed throughout the quiz

- Upon completion of the timer an alert appears informing the user that they are out of time and the quiz returns to the start once the user has acknowledged the alert.

- The timer also resets at this stage

- If the user scores atleast 7 correct answers out of 10 they are rewarded with a 'well done' message upon completion of the quiz and if they score 6 or less correct answers then the user is displayed a'better luck next time message.'
